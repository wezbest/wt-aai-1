## Findings

### 1. cys/how-to-answer-a-question.md

**Line 12:** "If the question is poorly formatted and you know how to reformat it reformat it and ask them next time to format their code."
- **Error:** Missing comma before "reformat it"
- **Correction:** "If the question is poorly formatted and you know how to reformat it, reformat it and ask them next time to format their code."
- **Impact:** Minor readability issue that could cause confusion about sentence structure.

**Line 18:** "If the problem has a poor title, doesn't make sense to others, etc, feel free to edit the question to what does if you can understand it."
- **Error:** Awkward phrasing "to what does"
- **Correction:** "If the problem has a poor title, doesn't make sense to others, etc, feel free to edit the question to make it clearer if you can understand it."
- **Impact:** Confusing sentence structure that impairs comprehension.

### 2. cys/CONTRIBUTING.md

**Line 8:** "Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`. E.g. for a repo named \"xyzRepo\", the user can run https://github.com/github-username/xyzRepo.git."
- **Error:** Missing "git clone" command in the example
- **Correction:** "Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`. E.g. for a repo named \"xyzRepo\", the user can run `git clone https://github.com/github-username/xyzRepo.git`."
- **Impact:** Could lead to user confusion when following the instructions, as the example is incomplete.

**Line 10:** "Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`. E.g `git checkout -b main`"
- **Error:** Missing period after "E.g" and poor example (main is typically the default branch name, not a feature branch)
- **Correction:** "Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`. E.g. `git checkout -b fix-issue-123`"
- **Impact:** Could mislead users about proper branch naming conventions.

### 3. cys/minimal-onboarding-questions.md

**Line 80:** "Example:\n​\n```"
- **Error:** Invisible character (zero-width space) before the code block
- **Impact:** Could cause formatting issues in some markdown parsers.

### 4. cys/how-to-ask-a-question.md

**Line 4:** "Also note, take this pledge: \"I solemnly swear that after asking a question I will spend at least 5 minutes trying to answer someone else's question. I will consult the 'How to answer a question' page before I do so. \""
- **Error:** Extra space before the closing quote
- **Correction:** "Also note, take this pledge: \"I solemnly swear that after asking a question I will spend at least 5 minutes trying to answer someone else's question. I will consult the 'How to answer a question' page before I do so.\""
- **Impact:** Minor formatting inconsistency.

**Line 55:** "stack exchange ETH."
- **Error:** Should be capitalized as it's a proper noun
- **Correction:** "Stack Exchange ETH."
- **Impact:** Minor inconsistency in proper noun capitalization.

### 5. cys/improvement_points.md

**Line 20:** "I think we should try Option A. Then, after each section, give students a DIFFERENT codebase for them to find the bugs in. Ideally these codebases can be made into first flights later."
- **Error:** "first flights" appears to be a term that may need clarification or capitalization if it's a proper noun
- **Impact:** Potential confusion about what "first flights" refers to.

## Summary

A total of 7 typos and grammatical errors were identified across 5 documentation files. Most errors are minor and relate to:

- Missing punctuation (commas, periods)

- Incomplete code examples
- Minor capitalization inconsistencies
- Formatting artifacts (invisible characters)

## Impact Assessment

**Low Impact:** Most errors do not significantly impair understanding but may affect the professional appearance of the documentation.
