## Proposed Change: Gasless Send Detector

I propose the addition of a new detector to Aderyn that specifically identifies instances of Ether being sent to a contract via `send()` or `transfer()` where the recipient's fallback function may consume more than the 2300 gas stipend. This can lead to unexpected transaction failures and create a potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

### Impact of the Proposed Change

This new detector would provide significant value to Aderyn users by:

*   **Preventing DoS Vulnerabilities:** By flagging potentially problematic transfers, the detector would help developers avoid situations where a contract's core functionality can be disrupted by a malicious or poorly-coded fallback function.
*   **Improving Code Robustness:** The detector would encourage developers to adopt safer Ether transfer practices, such as using the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern and favoring `call()` with explicit gas stipends over `send()` and `transfer()`.
*   **Enhancing Aderyn's Value Proposition:** The addition of this detector would further solidify Aderyn's position as a comprehensive and powerful static analysis tool for Solidity developers. It would demonstrate a commitment to addressing subtle but critical vulnerabilities that other tools might miss.

### Implementation Details

The new detector would need to:

1.  **Identify `send()` and `transfer()` calls:** The detector would scan the Solidity abstract syntax tree (AST) for all instances of `.send()` and `.transfer()`.
2.  **Analyze the recipient's fallback function:** For each identified call, the detector would need to analyze the recipient contract's fallback function (if one exists).
3.  **Flag potentially problematic fallbacks:** If the fallback function contains operations that are likely to consume more than 2300 gas (e.g., storage writes, complex calculations, or external calls), the detector would raise a warning.

This change would be a valuable addition to Aderyn's capabilities, helping developers write more secure and reliable smart contracts.
