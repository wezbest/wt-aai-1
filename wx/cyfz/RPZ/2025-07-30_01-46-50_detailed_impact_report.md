## Proposed Change: Gas-Stipend-Aware Ether Transfer Detector

I propose the addition of a new detector to Aderyn that identifies instances of Ether being sent to a contract using `send()` or `transfer()`. These functions forward a fixed gas stipend of 2300, which is often insufficient for even simple fallback functions, leading to transaction failures and potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

### Impact of the Proposed Change

The addition of this detector would be a significant improvement to Aderyn for the following reasons:

*   **Prevents Transaction Failures:** By flagging the use of `send()` and `transfer()`, the detector will help developers avoid situations where their contracts become stuck or inoperable due to insufficient gas being forwarded for the recipient's fallback function.
*   **Mitigates DoS Vulnerabilities:** The detector will help prevent DoS attacks where a malicious actor could intentionally create a contract with a gas-intensive fallback function to block incoming Ether transfers.
*   **Promotes Best Practices:** The detector will encourage the adoption of the recommended `.call{value: ...}("")` method for sending Ether, which forwards all available gas and provides better control over the transaction. This aligns with current Solidity development best practices.
*   **Increases Aderyn's Value:** This new detector will enhance Aderyn's reputation as a thorough and up-to-date static analysis tool that helps developers write more secure and robust smart contracts.

### Vulnerability Details

The `send()` and `transfer()` functions were designed as a security measure to prevent re-entrancy attacks by limiting the gas available to the recipient's fallback function. However, with the evolution of the Ethereum network and changes in gas costs, this fixed 2300 gas stipend is no longer a reliable mechanism. It is now widely considered a vulnerability because it can lead to unexpected transaction failures.

The recommended and safest way to transfer Ether is to use the `.call{value: ...}("")` method, which forwards all available gas and allows for more complex fallback functions. It is crucial to check the return value of the `call` to handle potential failures.

### Implementation Details

The new detector would need to:

1.  **Identify `send()` and `transfer()` calls:** The detector would scan the Solidity abstract syntax tree (AST) for all instances of `.send()` and `.transfer()`.
2.  **Flag their usage:** The detector would raise a warning for every instance of `send()` and `transfer()`, recommending the use of `.call{value: ...}("")` instead.
3.  **Provide a clear explanation:** The warning message should clearly explain the risks associated with `send()` and `transfer()` and provide a code example of the recommended alternative.

By implementing this detector, Aderyn will be better equipped to help developers avoid this common and impactful vulnerability.
